# [Jason Chiu's Site](https://codeberg.org/ljchiu)


Hi! I'm at Windsurf doing DevOps & ML Platform Engineering in the Bay Area! I
went to UIUC (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) for both my Bachelors in
CS + Music and Masters in CS. I enjoy doing Linux Administration, crafting
optimized Docker images, and working with Bazel, so feel free to contact me via
email:

- [`jobs@jasonchiu.slmail.me`](mailto:jobs@jasonchiu.slmail.me) (for job opportunities)
- [`general@jasonchiu.slmail.me`](mailto:general@jasonchiu.slmail.me) (anything else)
  - My public PGP key:
  [`DBED259BB132CCE96AC4D3F7689BA4FF85AA0D65`](/public.asc). Please
  also include your public key in your email if using it.
  - You can also request that I reply with a different email alias (via
  SimpleLogin; `slmail.me` is one of their domains).

You can also communicate with me on Matrix (install the Element app to chat), my
ID is `@jasonyip:matrix.org`

Or XMPP. My Jabber ID: `ljyip@nixnet.services`

My GitHub (which is not an instant messaging platform):
[`jaschiu`](https://github.com/jaschiu)

Happy to receive feedback in the open source work I do, or job opportunities
that fit my interests!

- CS222 (Software Design Lab)
- CS374 (Introduction to Algorithms & Models of Computation)
- CS361 (Probability & Statistics for Computer Science)
- CS421 (Programming Languages & Compilers)
- CS425 (Distributed Systems)
- CS438 (Communication Networks)
- CS410 (Text Information Systems)
- CS411 (Database Systems)
- CS498 (Cloud Computing Applications)

## Hobbies

Powerlifting and long-distance running. Competitive Smash Ultimate. Learning
the Lojban language. Gentoo Linux.

I still have my WIP Homelab project to do, but once it's ready, I will no longer
use GitHub pages to host this site (even if it means sacrificing `1 - 1e-9`
availability)
